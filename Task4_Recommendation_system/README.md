Spotify-Inspired Recommendation System (Task 4)

This project implements a simple recommendation system inspired by how Spotify suggests songs to users. It uses a content-based filtering approach to recommend songs based on similarity in genre and user mood.

Key features include mood-based personalization, popularity-based ranking, cold-start handling for unknown songs, and explainable recommendations that show why a song was suggested.

The project demonstrates basic Artificial Intelligence concepts used in real-world recommendation systems such as Spotify.

Technologies Used
