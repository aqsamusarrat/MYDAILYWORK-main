# Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Task 2)

This project implements an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human
player competes against an AI agent.

## Features
- Human vs AI gameplay
- AI powered by Minimax algorithm (unbeatable)
- Difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Hint system for player assistance
- Scoreboard tracking wins and draws
- Replay option

## AI Algorithm Used
Minimax Algorithm:
The AI evaluates all possible future game states and chooses the move
that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the opponent’s
best possible outcome.

## Outcome
The AI never loses in Hard mode, demonstrating basic game theory
and decision-making in Artificial Intelligence.
